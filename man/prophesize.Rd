\description{
Prophet is Facebook's procedure for forecasting time series data 
based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with 
yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It 
works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and 
several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing 
data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
